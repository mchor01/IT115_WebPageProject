            <p style="color:darkslateblue" class="text-center">Businesses all over the world are using social media tools in pretty much every aspect to get a glimpse of 
                the job candidate’s background or social media life to find more information about their life; outside of their resume or cover letter. Using tools such as 
                Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or LinkedIn will help them track and learn more about their personal life which gives them a general idea of whether the applicant 
                is qualified for the job or not. The future withholds many opportunities and divides within the business and applicant world because of how often we need to adapt 
                to the relevant platforms.

                <ul>
                    <li style="color:darkslateblue">As for the applicant side of things, social media is an important platform to express your personal life to 
                        employers in future job searches. It is revealed that “65% of companies said that social media posts have helped them research thoroughly on their applicants’ 
                        qualifications.” Many applicants will have that “fake it till you make” mentality and many companies know about that so they dig more into their personal 
                        life to find any flaws that they might have. For example, a company will not hire an applicant that has explicit or negative content on their social media pages 
                        even if they are technically advanced for that certain position. Another good example would be OnlyFans; a site where explicit content is posted and sold, was a 
                        good outlet for money but it also created a negative image on the applicant for future jobs since it was sensitive content for the public to see. Keeping a positive 
                        image of the company is of huge importance in maintaining its relevance so it is necessary to have a healthy environment. As a result, people will keep a standard 
                        on what is appropriate to publish for their career in the future.

                    <li style="color:darkslateblue">Social media can also be used as a form of a background check by employers. Employers can keep tabs on employees 
                        before and even after they are hired. Just because you got the job does not mean you can go on social media to say and post anything you want with no repercussions. 
                        Some companies have a certain reputation to uphold. An incident happened where a woman lost her internship at NASA because of some vulgar words she posted on Twitter. 
                        Naomi tweeted “Everyone shut the F- Up I got accepted for a NASA internship.” Homer Hickam, a member of the national space council, then replied saying, “Language.” 
                        to which Naomi replied telling him to “Suck my d- and balls I’m working at NASA”

                <ul>
                    <li style="color:darkslateblue">In the business world, companies are constantly adapting ways that they can promote 
                        their work through new social media platforms in order to reach their targeted audience. According to Sandeep Babu, from Small Business News, 
                        “Social media users are expected to reach 3.32 billion by 2022, and the internet users spend 144 minutes daily on social media networking sites.” 
                        As a result, companies are constantly creating new methods to build meaningful relationships with their future consumers. In terms of hiring applicants,
                        “34% of employers say social media posts have allowed them to filter candidates based on the content of their online profiles … showing behavior that is 
                        uncalled for can make or break their hiring potential.” This type of structure just shows that people are not just hiring for technical skills but 
                        also for good behavior and morals. By doing so, many companies have been influenced by doing the same thing because they have found a positive impact on their 
                        business when processing the applicant’s social media status. As time goes on, businesses will always be innovating and adapting to the required audience to 
                        create a healthy relationship on both sides.

                    <li style="color:darkslateblue">Instagram is an example of a social media platform that has evolved to be able to help any type of business. 
                        It was originally started as a  mobile platform to share photos with friends, family, and other like-minded individuals with similar interests. Now, although 
                        it still has that same core purpose, Instagram is used by businesses both big and small as a way to market their products to people across the world or for people 
                        to land deals with companies. Some Instagram users gain a following and then consider themselves “influencers'' and use this newfound following to promote something 
                        of theirs such as clothing or advertisements for the user’s other ventures. After amassing a following, they can then start their brand or try to get signed under 
                        a larger brand. Some of these influencers even choose to go through agencies that would help match them with larger brands.
