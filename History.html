            <p style="color:darkslateblue" class="text-center">Social media has become an integral part of all of our lives. We use it to connect with friends and family,
                 to catch up on current events, and, perhaps most importantly, to entertain ourselves. This is why just under 70 percent of Americans, 
                 and more than 2.6 billion active users globally, use social networking sites. However, this wasn’t always the case.
                  Back in just 2005, social media penetration in the U.S. was just 5 percent, and most of the rest of the internet didn’t even know what it was.
                   All of this means that the history of social media is a brief yet tumultuous one, and studying it can help us better understand just how much,
                    and how quickly, the world around us is changing

                    <li style="color:darkslateblue">In today’s digital age, social media is an increasingly important part of our daily lives. 
                        It has revolutionized communications, to the extent that it is now our preferred medium of everyday communication. 
                        Before social media, if you wanted to keep up with the news, you had to walk down to the newsstand in the morning
                         and buy a local edition reporting the events of the past week. Today, we get all the latest news and breaking stories
                          about Covid-19 or Elon Musk’s recent activities online. The last thing many people do before they go to sleep is scroll 
                          through their feeds and is probably the first thing before they rise out of covers. In the 2000s, we fancied mp3 players
                           or SEGA games, now we‘re weighing in on blogging throughout MySpace, Twitter, Pinterest etc.

                        extensive percentage of the world’s population. Social Media had emerged in different countries all over the world,
                         making international news and/or significant information — from showbiz to disasters/calamities and anything in between 
                         — more accessible to anyone around the globe. The existence of social media became undeniably disastrous and helpful, 
                         simultaneously. This post mainly focuses on the latter, since its importance globally became more evident now with the 
                         epidemic going on.
